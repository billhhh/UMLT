Hey guys,

How is it going?

The materials can be found at the homepage of the course (workshop section).

I have created several breakout rooms. You guys can choose any of them for discussion. Just make sure each room contains 2-3 people. We will go through questions and solutions together at around 12:00.

If you have any question, just ask me :).
